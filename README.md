This is a “Dash” application using “Pandas” for reading and manipulating data.
The app will update on the run if the data change (require refresh/navigate to another page),
but could be modified easily to be a one-time-read-and-go app. 

The Dash app is a “Dash Pages” app, for that, we got the “pages” directory containing the pages of the app, in that directory I saved a local Excel file as the database.
In the “pages” directory I added a “utility” file that contains all the functions and variables that make the graphs figures, data frames and calculations on them.

The “assets” directory contain all the CSS files and recognized vid dash automatically by
 Its name.

I used the following packages/frameworks(installation required):
pandas
dash_bootstarp_components
openpyxl

Had a lot of fun! :)
